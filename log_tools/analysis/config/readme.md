The config files in this folder document possible pipelines. 

For simple use cases, where the inputs are fixed and small in number, it is possible to provide a static config file. For complex use cases, where the number of inputs are unknown or large, it is expected that higher-level scripts will geneerate the pipeline config programmatically.
