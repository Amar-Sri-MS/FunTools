# Looks for message "sequences" in a log.
#
# It's not really a proper sequence... but I couldn't think of the right term
# on a lazy Sunday.
#
# The "sequence" of messages to look for is defined by a graph. The graph
# is meant to mimic a debugging decision tree. For example, in a FunOS
# log the following sequence means COMe probably got stuck as a result of
# a FunOS crash:
#     saw COMe powering up message -> did not see COMe enumeration message ->
#     saw FunOS bug_check
#
# In some cases the decision tree is the reverse of how we actually debug
# because we work backwards from the explosion. e.g.
#     saw ARP timeout <- did not see management port enabled message
#
# It should be possible to simplify the creation of the decision graphs with
# some type of DSL, maybe even python fragments. At the moment, specifying
# the JSON can be painful and error-prone.
#
# Usage: scan_log.py -h
