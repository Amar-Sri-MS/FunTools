                                 For HUE, there are two wu_crd_cnt. One is leaf credit
                                 counters, which get small number of WU credits from
                                 prefetch engine. The other one is remote credit counters,
                                 which mimic the remote hue wu credit counters.
                                 A wu credit will firstly allocate to leaf credit counters,
                                 then based on remote credit counter status (< remote_cnt_max),
                                 the wu credit will relocate to remote counters.
                                 So the total number of outstanding wu credits inside msc
                                 for hue0/1 is hue_leaf_wu_crd_cnt + hue_remote_wu_crd_cnt.
