          Block Synchronization Indication per virtual lane. When asserted (1) 
                                        the block synchronization state machines could successfully lock onto 
                                        66-bit block boundaries.
                                        The signals stay asserted as long as block lock is maintained.
                                        All 20 bits are relevant when the 100G PCS operates in normal mode indicating lock per Virtual Lane. 
                                        They are not relevant in RS-FEC mode. When the 100G PCS is not used the following bits per serdes lane are valid:
                                        When the Serdes Interface 0 operates in 25/10Geth mode then Bit 0 is used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 1 operates in 25/10Geth mode then Bit 5 is used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 2 operates in 25/10Geth mode then Bit 10 is used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 3 operates in 25/10Geth mode then Bit15 is used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 1 and 0 operates in 2-Lane 50Geth with no RS-FEC mode then Bits 6, 5, 1, 0 are used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 3 and 2 operates in 2-Lane 50Geth with no RS-FEC mode then Bits 16, 15, 11, 10 are used.
                                        When the Serdes Interface 3, 2, 1 and 0 operates in 4-Lane 100Geth with no RS-FEC mode then Bits 6, 5, 1, 0 are used.

          High Bit Error Rate indication. If asserted, at least 97 invalid synchronization headers 
                                        have been found in a 500us measurement period for 100GBASE-R indicating a high bit error rate.
                                        As long as hi_ber stays asserted, local fault is signaled on CGMII. hi_ber deasserts again, only 
                                        if less than 97 invalid synchronization headers have been detected within the same measurement period.
                                        Refer to IEEE 802.3ba Clause 82.2.18.3. Its purpose is to help monitor the quality of the link. When 
                                        the Core operates in 100Geth mode, only bit 0 is valid,

          Final link status indication. This is the logical result of align_lock=1 and hi_ber=0.
                                        When asserted (1) it indicates the link is in its normal operational state. The signal represents the link-status indication. 
                                        When the Core operates in 100Geth mode, only bit 0 is valid. 
                                        Note: When a channel has its SGMII PCS enabled this link status has no meaning and
                                        instead the SGMII PCS' status (sg_rx_sync) is then relevant.
