# This is a YAML filter file
# This allows the user to appropriately size the generated library
# to be linked against. It's usually a good idea to only include
# the stuff that you're truly interested in.
#
# The following verbs are supported:
#
# Topological/Namespace verbs
# include_{ring, interior, an, csr}
# exclude_{ring, interior, an, csr}
#
# exclude will remove *everything* from top level down, unless an include definition is encountered
# include must be a strict subset of exclude
# include includes everything under that tree.
# Default is to exclude everything. So, please choose wisely
# All of these specifications are regular expression that match from the beginning.
#
# CSR type filters
#
# In addition to the filters above, you can specify what *type* of CSRs you want.
#
# The attribute specifies this. It is in list form, and must include all the CSR types you are interested
# in. Please check attr_map.yaml for list of acceptable attributes
#
# include_attr: []
#

# This is just an example config. Please choose yours
