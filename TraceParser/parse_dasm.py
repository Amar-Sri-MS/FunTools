# parse_dasm.py: Parse disassembler contents to help build call graph
#
# This code parses MIPS disassembly in a simplistic way, and uses heuristics
# to build up a call graph of the original program.
#
# The data from this will be used by profiling tools using the Samurai
# trace data - which provides instruction and data traces from the
# processor or emulation.  The client of this code would be running through
# the trace, and whenever the PC changes to a different function, would
# ask for the kind of control flow baseed on the old and new address.
# The GetBranchKind function performs these queries.
# 
# To detect the branches correctly, this code needs to handle a couple of
# complications.  First, classic MIPS branches have the idea of a "forbidden"
# slot - that the instruction after the branch will be executed before the
# branch takes effect.  That means that an instruction sequence like:
# 0x1000: beqz 0x20000
# 0x1004: li t9, 0
#
# the instruction sequence would be 1000, 1004, 2000.  This code needs to
# recognize that the beqz means that the transition between functions would
# happen between address 0x1004 and 0x2000.
#
# Note that instructions ending in "C" (compact) don't have the forbidden word
# concept, and usually will jump from the same address.  Usually.
#
# The second problem is that the Samurai data is occasionally incorrect;
# instructions are sometimes missing, or wait instructions may have surprising
# results.  This code must handle such cases... or at least recover
# gracefully.
#
# This code doesn't care about local jumps within functions, but does
# need to handle recursive functions.  It also needs to handle jumps and calls
# to registers (function pointers).
