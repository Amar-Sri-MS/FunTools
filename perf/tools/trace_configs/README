This directory contains TCF files for the MIPS dequeuer.

TCF files are documented in the MIPS dequeuer documentation on Box:
https://fungible.box.com/s/8rc978p9xkzzb9jj38cgzlgwcl55m09q

cc_trace.tcf contains trace configuration for the control cluster.
pc_trace.tcf contains trace configuration for a processing cluster.

If the pdtrace configuration for FunOS is changed, the values in these files
need to be modified as well.
