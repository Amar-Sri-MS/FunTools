To get info about some google drive link simply run the gdrive_link_to_name script
and provide your link as a command line argument.

After migrating to OneDrive, we have seen that we have no way of knowing what
our google drive links point to.

This directory contains a JSON file that maps a file ID to the file name, type,
and file path (the file path may not include the full path, but the path included
is correct and of value).

The JSON contains mappings for all the files in the shared drive and certain other
files (mostly files we found referenced in FunOS that were not on the shared drive).
