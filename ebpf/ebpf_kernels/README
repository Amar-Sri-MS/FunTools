# Ebpf kernels (for testing)


## Conventions

Please follow convention to name the kernels as

k_01.c
k_02.c

## Compiling

`make` generates (by default) ebpf bytecode for the BPF VM.
`make install` installs this to the checked out FunOS repo tests. Modify ebpf_test under tests appropriately.
`make clean` removes everything.
