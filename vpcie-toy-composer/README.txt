This is a small, stand-alone Virtual PCIe Toy Composer.  It uses the
Fungible Cluster Services Virtual PCIe Fabric Manager to implement most of
its functionality.  This Toy Composer is useful for testing, development,
product demonstrations, and as an example for those writing real Composers.

The Python3 source for this Toy Composer is mostly self-documenting.  The
emphasis is on readability and useability.
