Files in this folder are under GPL license and they may be used by other SDK components.
Note that scripts under GPL license may be freely used during the build process, but
they must be released in the GPL source package.
It would have been OK from licensing perspective to keep the scripts directly in the
folders where they are used (eg. FunOS), but they are kept separate to make the license
difference clearly visible.
